## Introduction
* General information:
   * with the help of image we have created using portenta H7, we genrated a model capable of predicting traffic road signs
   * the python file creating the tflite file is written in jupyter notebook and the model is then deployed into the micro controller.

## Project Aim
* Goals of this project:
   * To develop a model that can predict different road signs accurately
   * run the model in the portenta micro controller
   * It detects image using portents camera and classifies the image(road sign).
